1. Who uses the computer:
    I did this in windows by extracting the files from zip folder using 7zip. and then i googled where is
    the user info stored in linux and got to know it is found in list home/ , so i checked the home folder in 
    in file explorer, and found a folder named "emmetbrown".

2.  Password-check:
    For this i searched how to check password changed in linux and where is it stored, and got a stackoverflow 
    article and then i check in folder var/log/messages and searched "passwd" in messages file and converted the
    time accoring to epoch system.

3. Browsing the interwebs:
    Again found a stackoverflow article and check inside var/log/messages and searched for firefox and converted 
    time to epoch system.

4. delete my browsing history:
    For this question I checked where is firefox history stores history, and in what format is it stored. But
    I was not able to get to the final answer becuase i was not able to operate on the sqlite file.

5. Say my name:
    I checked the etc/fstab file after following a stackoverflow article, and found that root partition is mounted 
    at `/` in fstab and i copied the uuid present there.
